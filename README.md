# ðŸŽ¯ College Directory Application
The **College Directory Application** is a comprehensive web-based system that manages various entities within a college environment, such as students, faculty, and administrators. The platform allows users to interact with a centralized database to manage student profiles, faculty information, and administrative operations like searching and managing records. The application supports multiple roles including **Student**, **Faculty Member**, and **Administrator**, each with specific privileges.

The system uses **Spring Boot** for backend services, **React.js** for the frontend interface, and **PostgreSQL** for database management. It also integrates **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authentication and role-based access control, ensuring that users can only access resources appropriate to their roles.

## Tech Stack

The following technologies and tools were used to build this project:

### Backend:
- **Spring Boot** - A Java-based framework used for building the backend RESTful APIs.
- **Spring Data JPA** - Provides ORM support for managing database records with Java Persistence API.
- **Spring Security** - Handles authentication and authorization within the application.
- **PostgreSQL** - The relational database used for storing all data.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** - Used for stateless user authentication.

### Frontend:
- **React.js** - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios** - For making HTTP requests from React to the Spring Boot API.
- **CSS** - For styling the user interface.
